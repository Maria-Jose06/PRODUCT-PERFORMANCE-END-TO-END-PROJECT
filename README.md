This project analyzes product sales performance using MySQL and Power BI.
In MySQL, I cleaned, structured, and joined multiple datasets (products, sales, and discounts) through SQL queries and CTEs to calculate revenue, costs, and discount-adjusted metrics.
Then, I visualized the results in Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard to explore product profitability and sales trends.
